# Mapping_Earthquakes
mapping out earthquakes around the world
## Overview
A brief overview for this repository is creating a map that shows earthquakes around the world in the past 7 days. The map was created by using Leaflet & MapBox. The map had multiple layers, including markers for all earthquakes, a marker showing the tectonic plates and markers for showing major earthquakes. 
## Results
This map includes three different Mapbox styles. These styles are street style, satellite style and light style. Another option besides choosing which style to view, the map also includes a way to toggle on and off on which markers are on the map. These markers include an Earthquakes marker, Tectonic plates marker and a Major Earthquake marker.  The markers for Earthquakes and Major Earthquakes are varied on size based on the magnitude of the earthquake. The markers also vary in color based on the magnitude of the earthquakes, which a legend indicates at the bottom right of the map.
